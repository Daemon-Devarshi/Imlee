####General:

Imlee is a simple application which is used to change the type of an image. 

You can change its type simply by dropping it on image view and saving it as different type. 

The main intend of making this application is to play with language features provided in cocoa and objective c (discussed below).

####Language features used:

1. protocol
2. NSImageView subclass
3. drag and drop
4. mouse down event
5. bindings
6. key value observing
7. model view controller architecture
8. predicate

####Final Words:

I hope this application will be fun to play with for both users and developers â€¦ enjoy :-)
